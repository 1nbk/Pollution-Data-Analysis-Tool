Okay, let's break down the Python code for your pollution data analyzer. It's designed to perform numerical analysis on pollution concentration data, particularly using the Romberg integration method.

The code is typically structured into two main files for the Streamlit application:

1.  **`pollution_analyzer_logic.py`**: This file contains the core computational logic, including the Romberg integrator and the pollution data analysis capabilities.
2.  **`streamlit_app.py`**: This file builds the web-based user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the logic defined in `pollution_analyzer_logic.py`.

Let's go through `pollution_analyzer_logic.py` section by section:

### `pollution_analyzer_logic.py` Explained

This file contains three main components: a numerical integration class, a class for analyzing pollution data, and a utility function to create sample data.

#### 1. `RombergIntegrator` Class

This class implements the **Romberg Method**, which is a numerical technique used to approximate the definite integral of a function. It's more accurate than simpler methods like the basic trapezoidal rule.

* **`__init__(self, tolerance: float = 1e-6, max_iterations: int = 20)`**:
    * This is the constructor. When you create a `RombergIntegrator` object, it sets up two important parameters:
        * `tolerance`: How close the successive approximations of the integral need to be before the method stops. A smaller `tolerance` means more accuracy but potentially more calculations. (Default: 0.000001)
        * `max_iterations`: The maximum number of times the method will refine its approximation. This prevents the calculation from running forever if the desired `tolerance` can't be reached. (Default: 20)

* **`integrate(self, func: Callable[[float], float], a: float, b: float) -> Tuple[float, int]`**:
    * This is the core method that performs the integration.
    * `func`: The function you want to integrate. It must be a function that takes a single float (the `x` value) and returns a single float (the `y` value). In your case, this will be your pollution concentration interpolation function.
    * `a`: The lower limit of integration (the start point on the x-axis).
    * `b`: The upper limit of integration (the end point on the x-axis).
    * **What it does:** It repeatedly applies the trapezoidal rule with increasingly smaller step sizes and uses a technique called **Richardson Extrapolation** to "extrapolate" to a more accurate integral value. It fills a table (`R`) with these approximations. It stops when the difference between successive approximations is less than the `tolerance` or when `max_iterations` is reached.
    * **Returns:** A tuple containing the calculated integral value (the total area under the curve) and the number of iterations used.

#### 2. `PollutionDataAnalyzer` Class

This is the central class that manages your pollution data and performs various analyses using the `RombergIntegrator`.

* **`__init__(self)`**:
    * Initializes the analyzer.
    * `self.romberg = RombergIntegrator()`: Creates an instance of the `RombergIntegrator`. This means the analyzer has its own Romberg tool ready to perform integrations.
    * `self.data_points = []`: An empty list to store the pollution concentration values.
    * `self.time_points = []`: An empty list to store the corresponding time points (often just indices representing hours from start).

* **`generate_sample_data(self, days: int = 30) -> None`**:
    * A utility method to create artificial pollution data.
    * It generates hourly concentration values for a specified number of `days` (default 30).
    * The data has a simulated daily cycle (using sine wave), weekly variation, random noise, and occasional spikes, making it somewhat realistic for testing.
    * It populates `self.data_points` and `self.time_points`.

* **`load_data_from_csv(self, filename: str) -> None`**:
    * Designed to load pollution data from a CSV file.
    * It expects the CSV to have a header row and then columns where the second column (`row[1]`) contains the concentration values.
    * It populates `self.data_points` and `self.time_points` from the CSV. It includes basic error handling for `FileNotFoundError`.

* **`create_interpolation_function(self) -> Callable[[float], float]`**:
    * This is a crucial method that prepares your discrete data points for integration.
    * Since the Romberg integrator expects a continuous function (`func(x)`), this method creates a **piecewise linear interpolation function**.
    * **What it does:** It returns an inner function (`interpolate`). When `interpolate(t)` is called, it finds where `t` (a specific time) falls between your known `time_points` and uses the corresponding `data_points` to calculate the pollution concentration at time `t` by drawing a straight line between the two closest known data points.
    * It also handles edge cases where `t` is outside the range of your data.

* **`calculate_total_exposure(self, start_time: float = None, end_time: float = None) -> dict`**:
    * Calculates the total pollution exposure over a given time period.
    * `start_time` and `end_time`: The time range for which to calculate exposure. If not provided, it uses the full range of available data.
    * **How it works:**
        1.  It gets the `interpolation_func` from `create_interpolation_function()`.
        2.  It uses `self.romberg.integrate()` to integrate this `interpolation_func` from `start_time` to `end_time`. The integral represents the "area under the pollution curve," which is a measure of total exposure (e.g., µg·hour/m³).
        3.  It also calculates the average concentration over that period.
    * **Returns:** A dictionary with `total_exposure`, `average_concentration`, `time_period`, `integration_iterations`, and the start/end times.

* **`analyze_peak_exposure(self, threshold: float = 50.0) -> dict`**:
    * Analyzes how much pollution occurred above a specific `threshold`.
    * `threshold`: A concentration level (e.g., 50 µg/m³).
    * **How it works:**
        1.  It defines a new temporary function `excess_pollution` which returns `0` if the concentration is below the `threshold` and `(concentration - threshold)` if it's above.
        2.  It integrates this `excess_pollution` function over the entire data range using `self.romberg.integrate()`. The result is the "total excess exposure."
        3.  It also counts how many individual hours (data points) had concentrations above the `threshold`.
    * **Returns:** A dictionary with the `threshold`, `total_excess_exposure`, `hours_above_threshold`, `percentage_above_threshold`, and `integration_iterations`.

* **`calculate_daily_averages(self) -> List[dict]`**:
    * Calculates the average pollution concentration for each full 24-hour day in your data.
    * **How it works:** It iterates through the data in 24-hour segments, using `self.romberg.integrate()` for each day, and then divides the daily integral by 24 to get the average.
    * **Returns:** A list of dictionaries, each containing the `day` number and its `average_concentration`.

* **`generate_report(self) -> str`**:
    * Compiles a comprehensive text-based report summarizing various analyses.
    * It calls `calculate_total_exposure()`, `analyze_peak_exposure()`, and `calculate_daily_averages()` to gather information.
    * It then formats all these results into a readable string, including a basic health risk assessment based on WHO guidelines.
    * **Returns:** A multi-line string containing the full report.

#### 3. `create_sample_csv(filename: str = 'pollution_data.csv', days: int = 30)` Function

* This is a standalone function (not part of a class) that helps you generate a sample CSV file.
* It internally creates a `PollutionDataAnalyzer` instance and uses its `generate_sample_data` method to get data.
* Then, it writes this generated data into a CSV file with `Hour`, `Concentration_ugm3`, and `Location` columns.
* This is useful for providing a default dataset for your Streamlit app or for users to download.

### How It All Connects (with `streamlit_app.py`)

The `streamlit_app.py` file uses these components:

* It `import`s the classes and functions from `pollution_analyzer_logic.py`.
* It creates an instance of `PollutionDataAnalyzer`.
* It provides a user interface (buttons, input fields, sliders) to:
    * Choose between generating sample data or uploading a CSV (which then uses `analyzer.generate_sample_data()` or `analyzer.load_data_from_csv()`).
    * Display the data using Matplotlib.
    * Call `analyzer.generate_report()` and display the output in a text area.
    * Allow users to input custom time ranges or thresholds and then call `analyzer.calculate_total_exposure()` or `analyzer.analyze_peak_exposure()` to show specific results.
    * Display daily averages using `analyzer.calculate_daily_averages()`.
    * Offer a button to download a sample CSV using the `create_sample_csv()` function.

In essence, `pollution_analyzer_logic.py` does all the heavy lifting and number crunching, while `streamlit_app.py` provides the user-friendly wrapper.
